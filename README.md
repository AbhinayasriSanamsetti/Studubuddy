STUDY BUDDY
StudyBuddy is a collaborative learning platform built using Django.
It allows users to create accounts, join topic-based rooms, participate in discussions, and connect with other learners.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and interactive space for students to find study partners and engage in meaningful academic conversations.
